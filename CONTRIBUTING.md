# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or
to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code Reviews

We trust contributors to use their best judgement as to whether a commit should
be reviewed. We hope to establish a culture in which contributors voluntarily
wait for approval of substantial changes (e.g. non-tiny, non-obvious, or
impactful to design or features).

We use pull requests as a mechanism for requesting review and approving commits.

For changes expected to involve substantial effort, contributors are encouraged
to start discussion using an issue before investing substantial coding effort.

## Code Formatting

Please auto format before committing using yapf with the .style.yapf at the root
of this project. (yapf automatically looks for this config file in parent
directories.) This provides a definite (though arbitrary) convention to minimize
the impact of whitespace-only differences on merge effort and to avoid needing
to debate formatting in code reviews.
